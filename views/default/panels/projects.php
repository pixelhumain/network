		People are awesome and constently transform their needs into projects
		<br/> Big or small projects often get people together for a bigger reason
		<br/> Projects often make things better, People are constantly building.
		<br/> Sometimes we have a lot of energy we could share 
		<br/> but simply don't know how much is happening near by
		<br/> sometimes we don't have the energy of doing things alone
		<br/> and all that's missing is a team
		<br/> What if Local Projects were easier to find, join and promote
