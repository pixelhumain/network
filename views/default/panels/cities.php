		People have walked quite a path since they started building tools 
		<br/> Cities are the largest of all man's creations
		<br/> Constantly evolving with technology and social movements
		<br/> Cities are living organisms made of layers, just like forests
		<br/> But Forests seem to have very little impact on nature
		<br/> We need to move towards Natural Efficiency to reduce our global impact
		<br/> while communicating massively and building everything smarter.
